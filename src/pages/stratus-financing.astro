          Stratus Financial was founded by FAA Certificated Flight and Ground
          Instructors passionate about helping others achieve their aviation
          dreams. With Stratus, the sky is no longer the limit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted-700 mt-4 text-base leading-7 dark:text-white">
          We know it’s not just about achieving your dreams (because we looked
          up in the sky every time we heard an airplane too!), but funding your
          family’s dreams as well. That’s why Stratus was created — to make
          financing your aviation career possible.
