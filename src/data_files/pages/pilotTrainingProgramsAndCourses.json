You'll also need to complete ground training where you'll study weather, regulations, aerodynamics and more. Pilots first start out with their private pilot certificate and then move on to more advanced ratings and certifications depending on your goals.",

There are three main exams you'll need to satisfactorily complete: The medical exam, the written test, and the practical exam. When you fly at Blue Skies Above, you'll get one on one mentorship with one of our CFIs (certified flight instructor) that will guide you through every step of the way. Start today and let's start flying!"
