      "The first thing thing we'll go over is your schedule. How many times per week are you able to dedicate to flight training? We'll then take a look at the syllabus and match the lessons to fit your schedule.",
      "We recommend flying at least 2 to 3 times per week to optimize for retention. Flying less often means that there is a longer period where you're likely to forget things. Each flight lesson, you're relearning some of the things you may have forgotten. When you fly more frequently, you are able to solidify fundamental concepts quicker and become a better pilot.",
      "Your initial flight lessons will focus on building a foundational understanding of aviation principles. In the classroom, you'll cover topics such as aerodynamics, navigation, and aircraft systems. Expect comprehensive lessons to lay the groundwork for your practical flying experiences.",
      "As you progress into the practical phase of flight training, you'll spend considerable time flying the airplane. Initial flights will concentrate on flying straight and level, takeoffs, and landings. Instructors will guide you through the essential skills needed to operate an aircraft safely. Expect a structured curriculum designed to gradually increase the complexity of your flight exercises, allowing you to develop confidence and proficiency in handling various in flight scenarios.",
      "Staying consistent and having the determination to make your dreams a reality is what it takes. You consistently keep learning and developing yourself into a skilled aviator. You review your notes, study your lessons, and practice consistently so that you're ready for the next lesson each time.",
      "Ask questions. Discuss with your CFI concepts that you don't fully understand.",
      "Have fun and enjoy flying the Blue Skies Above."
