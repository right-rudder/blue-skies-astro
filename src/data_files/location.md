Step 2.
Take a Discovery Flight
Also known as an introductory flight, a discovery flight is your first flight lesson. Pair up with a certified flight instructor and you fly the plane.

On a discovery flight, you'll spend 30 minutes to an hour in the air with a certified flight instructor. You'll have the chance to fly the airplane on your own. After you land, you'll have the opportunity to discuss with your instructor how to complete the flight training process. Complete a discovery flight to see if pilot training is a good fit for you.

Step 3.

Flight Training
You'll pair up and work with a CFI (Certified Flight Instructor) to start flight training. Gain the necessary skills and knowledge to pass your written and practical exams.

The first certificate pilots get is called the private pilot certificate, also known as the PPL or private pilot license. Obtaining this certification involves passing multiple exams including the medical exam, the written exam, and the practical exam - commonly referred as the checkride. You and your instructor will come up with a plan that fits your schedule to get this complete. We're excited to be a part of your aviation journey.
