## What is an Instrument Rating?

When you start flying, you learn about different weather conditions and the challenges weather entails including visibility, cloud coverage, and thunderstorms. As a private pilot, you're limited to flying in good weather. Sometimes, weather conditions make flying visually unsafe, and that's where the instrument rating comes in.

Getting an instrument rating is the next step in your training. It allows you to handle more challenging weather with proper training. Essentially, you'll learn to fly by focusing only on your flight instruments, without relying on the ground or horizon. This skill is crucial for flying in less than ideal weather conditions.

During the process, you'll understand the rules, procedures, and the published minimums to fly safely in such conditions. It's about expanding your skills and flying confidently in more complex weather situations.

## Key Training Steps

1. **Complete Your Private Pilot**: You must have finished your private pilot in order to start training for your instrument rating.

2. **Pass Your Instrument Written Exam**: Study and solidify core instrument rating concepts. Be able to reach approach plates and IFR charts. Understand the US Air Traffic Control System and your role as a pilot in the system.

3. **Meet Minimum Requirements**: You'll need to complete 50 hours of cross country time and at least 40 hours under the hood. You'll also need to fly an IFR cross country and complete training with an instructor.
