    paragraph: "As a student pilot, aspiring aviator, or aircraft owner, staying updated with the latest FAA regulations is crucial for safe and compliant flying. Below are the most significant rule changes of the past year and how they impact your training and operations at Blue Skies Above Flight School."
  },
  {
    title: "1. Updated Flight Review Requirements (14 CFR §61.56)",
    paragraph: "Partial credit now applies when you complete an FAA‑approved proficiency check (e.g., airline‑transport pilot check) or complete specified advanced training courses. Greater emphasis on scenario‑based training, risk management, and judgment exercises as part of the Flight Review content."
  },
  {
    title: "Blue Skies Above implementation",
    paragraph: "We’ve embedded scenario‑based modules and real‑world scenarios directly into both the PPL and IR syllabi. Our ground‑school classrooms host complimentary Flight Review clinics twice annually, letting you sharpen maneuvers and risk skills with our CFIs before your official review."
  },
  {
    title: "2. Airspace Adjustments (Class B / Class C / Class E)",
    paragraph: "Several Class C “core” and “shelf” boundaries were redrawn around busy metropolitan airports to reduce controller workload and improve traffic flow. ADS‑B Out equipage requirements expanded: ADS‑B Out is now mandatory in all Class E airspace above 3,000 feet MSL."
  },
  {
    title: "Blue Skies Above implementation",
    paragraph: "All Cessna 172 trainers in our fleet are fully ADS‑B Out equipped; later this year, we’ll upgrade to ADS‑B In to let students practice weather and traffic overlays. Cross‑country lesson plans now include hands‑on briefings with updated sectional charts and electronic flight bag (EFB) tutorials covering new airspace boundaries."
  },
  {
    title: "3. Aeronautical Decision‑Making (ADM) and Risk Management Standards",
    paragraph: "The FAA has codified best practices for ADM, requiring explicit instruction on human factors, risk assessment, automation management, and fatigue mitigation. Instructors must document ADM discussions in training records and emphasize risk management strategies during every lesson."
  },
  {
    title: "Blue Skies Above implementation",
    paragraph: "Each pre‑flight briefing now follows a structured risk‑management checklist based on FAA’s Safety Team (FAASTeam) guidelines. We host quarterly Safety Stand‑Down events—open to all students—where we analyze recent incidents, share lessons learned, and reinforce ADM techniques."
  },
  {
    title: "4. Updated Aeronautical Chart Supplements and Sectional Maps",
    paragraph: "The FAA updated multiple Chart Supplements entries, including new FBO details, updated frequencies, and corrected airfield elevations. Sectional chart symbology refinements (e.g., improved depiction of military operations areas) to help pilots recognize special use airspace."
  },
  {
    title: "Blue Skies Above implementation",
    paragraph: "Ground‑school materials are refreshed monthly to pull in the latest Chart Supplement data directly from the FAA’s digital database. We provide every student with instructor‑led workshops on interpreting revised sectional symbols and database updates on their EFB apps."
  },
  {
    title: "What This Means for You",
