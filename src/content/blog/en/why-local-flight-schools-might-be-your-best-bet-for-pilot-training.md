      paragraph: "So you've caught the flying bug and you're ready to earn your wings? That's awesome! But now comes the big question: where should you get your flight training?

      title: "You're Not Just Another Number",
      paragraph: "Picture this: you walk into your local flight school and your certified flight instructor (CFI) actually knows your name. They remember that you struggled with crosswind landings last week and they've been thinking about a new way to explain it. That's the magic of local flight training schools like Blue Skies Above in Lanett, Alabama.",

      title: "Life Happens , And That's Okay",

Whether you need to fly twice this week or skip next due to personal obligations, local schools can accommodate your real life.",
