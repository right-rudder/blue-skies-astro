      title: "Why Instructing Helps You Build Hours",
      paragraph: "To fly for the airlines, you need 1,500 total flight hours. Most students finish commercial training with around 250 hours. That leaves a gap of about 1,250 hours. Renting a plane or buying flight time is costly and time-consuming. When you work as a CFI, you build those hours while getting paid to fly. At Blue Skies Above, our CFIs fly daily with students and often log 80 to 100 hours per month, depending on weather and student demand.",

Instructors build stronger communication, awareness, and decision-making skills. At Blue Skies Above, our CFIs work with a wide range of students, gaining diverse experience that translates directly into safer, more capable flying.",
