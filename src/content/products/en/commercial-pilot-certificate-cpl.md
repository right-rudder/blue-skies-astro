## What is a Commercial Pilot Certificate?

A Commercial Pilot Certificate allows you to fly for compensation or hire, opening doors to various aviation careers such as flight instructing, surveying, skydiving operations, and more. At Blue Skies Above, we provide structured training programs that prepare you for these opportunities.

When you start commercial pilot training, you'll deepen your understanding of aviation regulations, including the requirements for different parts of the FAR, and learn to fly with greater precision.

Although not mandatory, completing your Instrument Rating alongside your Commercial Pilot Certificate expands the types of flying you can do for compensation, such as under Part 135 operations.

## Training Requirements

1. **Complete Your Instrument Rating**: While not technically a requirement, not having an instrument rating when completing your commercial pilot certificate limits you in the type of flying you can do for compensation.

2. **Log Flight Hours**: You need 250 total flight hours to get your commercial pilot certificate. 110 of these hours are normally logged when getting your PPL and IR, but the other 140 will be logged via time building.

3. **Meet Minimum Requirements**: Once you're approaching 250 total flight hours, there are different types of cross-country trips that you are required to complete to meet the minimum requirements to take the commercial pilot practical exam.

4. **Fly With an Examiner**: You'll fly with an FAA Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) and demonstrate you have the skills to fly as a commercial pilot in a TAA aircraft and meet the requirements of the Airmen Certification Standards (ACS).

## What to Expect During Training

Prepare to fly at a higher standard, where precision is key. The ACS standards for commercial pilots are stricter compared to private pilots, ensuring you develop the skills needed to fly professionally.

Our training focuses on:
- Advanced maneuvers with commercial-level precision
- Complex aircraft operations
- Professional decision-making
- Commercial flight operations and regulations
- Career preparation and interview skills

## Career Paths After Certification

Once you complete your commercial pilot training, various aviation roles become accessible:

- **Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)**: Teach aspiring pilots while building flight hours
- **Survey Pilot**: Conduct aerial surveys for mapping and environmental monitoring
- **Skydive Pilot**: Provide ascents for skydiving operations
- **Charter Pilot**: Transport passengers or cargo on demand
- **Agricultural Pilot**: Perform crop dusting operations
- **Missionary Pilot**: Serve remote communities with transport services
- **Airline Pilot**: Begin your path to the airlines (with additional ratings)
