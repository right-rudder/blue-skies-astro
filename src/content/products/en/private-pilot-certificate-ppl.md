  subTitle: |
    The time required to obtain a Private Pilot Certificate typically ranges between a few months to a year, contingent upon factors such as frequency of lessons, individual aptitude, and weather conditions affecting training. It involves flying for a minimum of 40 hours which includes both solo and instructor guided flights with Blue Skies Above expert CFIs. On average, students need around 60 hours to be ready for the checkride. Additionally, candidates must pass a written exam, a flight test demonstrating their flying skills, and meet medical requirements set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

  - title: Meet Your Certified Flight Instructor
    subTitle: Once you decide to begin training, you’ll be paired with a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI). Together, you’ll create a tailored plan based on your goals and availability, backed by the full support of the Blue Skies Above team.
  - title: Build a Consistent Flight Schedule
    subTitle: Early on, you’ll work with your instructor to set a training schedule. We recommend flying 2–3 times per week to build strong retention and steady progress. More frequent lessons help reinforce key concepts and reduce the need for review.
  - title: Learn the Fundamentals
    subTitle: Your training begins with ground instruction, where you’ll study essential topics like aerodynamics, navigation, and aircraft systems. This foundation prepares you for hands-on flight lessons that start with the basics—flying straight and level, takeoffs, and landings.
  - title: Develop Skills & Confidence
    subTitle: Each lesson builds on the last with increasing complexity. You'll practice handling in-flight scenarios, improve your decision-making, and gain confidence in the cockpit. Staying consistent, studying regularly, and asking questions are the keys to your success.
