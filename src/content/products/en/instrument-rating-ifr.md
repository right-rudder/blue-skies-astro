## What is an Instrument Rating?

When you start flying, you learn about different weather conditions and the challenges weather entails including visibility, cloud coverage, and thunderstorms. As a private pilot, you're limited to flying in good weather. Sometimes, weather conditions make flying visually unsafe, and that's where the instrument rating comes in.

Getting an instrument rating is the next step in your training. It allows you to handle more challenging weather with proper training. Essentially, you'll learn to fly by focusing only on your flight instruments, without relying on the ground or horizon. This skill is crucial for flying in less than ideal weather conditions.

During the process, you'll understand the rules, procedures, and the published minimums to fly safely in such conditions. It's about expanding your skills and flying confidently in more complex weather situations.

## Key Training Steps

1. **Complete Your Private Pilot**: You must have finished your private pilot in order to start training for your instrument rating.

2. **Pass Your Instrument Written Exam**: Study and solidify core instrument rating concepts. Be able to reach approach plates and IFR charts. Understand the US Air Traffic Control System and your role as a pilot in the system.

3. **Meet Minimum Requirements**: You'll need to complete 50 hours of cross country time and at least 40 hours under the hood. You'll also need to fly an IFR cross country and complete training with an instructor.

4. **Fly With an Examiner**: You'll fly with a FAA Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) and demonstrate you have the skills to fly IFR and meet the requirements of the Airmen Certification Standards (ACS).

Blue Skies Above will prepare you for all of the required exams with the necessary materials and education. Give us a call and schedule a discovery flight to get started.

## Why Get an Instrument Rating?

### Improved Safety
One of the most compelling reasons to get an instrument rating is the improvement in safety it provides. By learning to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), you'll be better equipped to handle unexpected weather events and other challenges that may arise during flight.

### Enhanced Career Opportunities
An instrument rating can also strengthen your career prospects as a pilot. Many airlines and other aviation employers prefer to hire pilots with instrument ratings, as they demonstrate a higher level of skill and professionalism.

### Improved Situational Awareness
By learning to fly using instruments, you'll develop a heightened sense of awareness and attention to detail that can translate to all aspects of flying.

### Increased Enjoyment
Many pilots find that getting an instrument rating enhances their enjoyment of flying. With an instrument rating, you'll have the skills and confidence to fly in a wider range of conditions.
